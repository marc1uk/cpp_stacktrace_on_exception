Improved stacktrace print function by Yale Zhang from https://stackoverflow.com/a/63855266.
Other stacktrace print functions based on boost::stacktrace and gdb are also included.
The gdb version also prints local variables and threading information, but is much slower.
Ensure your application is compiled with debug symbols (`-g`) and linker options `-ldl -rdynamic` (or `-Wl,-export-dynamic`).

compilation: `make hack2` (builds the library version)
Then to print stacktraces on exceptions when running your program, preload this library when calling your binary:
LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libstacktrace_on_exception.so ./main <args>

An alternative, shorter version of a program to override __cxa_throw is included from https://stackoverflow.com/a/11674810.
